{"content": "\u003cp\u003eWas looking to replace my budgeting app YNAB (youneedabudget.com), with a :fosstodon: alternative, plus save the $7 a month!

Just spin it up as a Docker container on my server. Plus I would really like my finances encrypted and private, so definitely an added benefit there too!
